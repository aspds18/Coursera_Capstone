# Bike trip planning in NYC using Foursquare and Machine Learning techniques
This repository contains the assignments and the final project of the IBM Data Science Capstone course (part of a specialization). The project describe a procedure that can be used to plan bike trips using data from a bike share network, the Foursquare API to find point of interests and kMeans algorithm to group the stations based on common features.

The data includes the list of stations and the recording of bike usage between stations for various months. For the purpose of this project one month has been selected:
